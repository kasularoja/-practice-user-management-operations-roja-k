# Advanced SQL Practice

This project includes my practice queries for advanced SQL topics like JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, WHERE, and SubQueries.  

**What did I learn?**  
I learned how to combine data from multiple tables using JOINs, how to group data with aggregate functions, and how to filter data dynamically using subqueries.

**What was most challenging?**  
Remembering when to use `HAVING` vs `WHERE` was the most challenging, especially when combining them with `GROUP BY`.
